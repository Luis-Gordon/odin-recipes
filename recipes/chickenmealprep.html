    <h3>This is a recipe for preparing chicken, rice, and broccoli for the whole week.</h3>
    <p>
        First the chicken breasts are seasoned, covered in cling wrap, and left to marinate for while.
        Next place the rice into a bowl, fill it with water, and drain it. Repeat until the water remains clear while washing.
        Place the rice into the rice cooker, add the 1.5 times the amount of water, salt until slightly salty, 
        and start the rice cooker.

    <p>
        Place a pan on the stove and pre-heat it to the maximum temperature. Add sufficient oil with a high smoke point to prevent sticking, 
        and add the first batch of chicken breast to the pan. Sear both sides and place onto an oven tray covered with parchment paper. 
        Repeat this process until all of the chicken is seared, then place the tray into the oven and set it to 100 degrees Celsius.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the rice and chicken are cooking place the frozen broccoli into a large pot with a steaming sieve. Add salt multiple times and shake 
        and/or stir the broccoli to ensure an even distribution. When everything is done, remove the ingredients from their cooking devices, 
        weigh them and evenly distribute across the seven meal prep containers. Voila, dinner for a whole week is served.
