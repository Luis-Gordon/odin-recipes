    <h3>This a recipe for preparing the perfect golden, runny, but firm hard boiled egg.</h3>
    <p>Place one egg in a pot and fill it with enough water to completely submerge it, 
        while leaving about 1-2 cm between the egg and the surface of the water, 
        then remove the egg. 
    </p>
    <p>Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to about two thirds of maximum 
        to avoid splashing and unnecessary rattling of the eggs. Gently place the eggs 
        into the pot with a spoon and set a timer for between 5-7 minutes depending on your
        preference. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After the timer has ended remove the eggs again with a spoon, dry them off, 
        and place them in egg cups, as they're now ready to be served. Enjoy.
